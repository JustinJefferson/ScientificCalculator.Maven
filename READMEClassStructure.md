# Scientific Calculator Class Structure

For this project we need 3 classes not including the test class; a calculator class, a ExtendedCalculator class, and an interface class. The calculator and ExtendedCalculator class wiil contain methods dealing with the mathmatical operations. The interface class will take user inputs through a string in the console and  call upon the appropriate functions in the order they need to be called upon.
