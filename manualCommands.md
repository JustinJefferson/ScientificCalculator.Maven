# Calculator Manual

These are commands for inputting into the interface

The variable `num` will be replaced by the number you would like to input

an integer will replace the current working number

An arithmatic followed by a integer will perform that operation on the current working number

Input | Expression and Result
:-----: | :-----
`num` | replaces the working number with value
`+ num` | adds value to working number
`- num` | subtracts value from working number
`* num` | multiplies working number by value
`/ num` | divides working number by value
`square` | finds the square of the current working number
`sqrt num` | finds the square root of a value
`^num` | finds the exponential of the working number by a value
`invert`| finds the value of 1 divided by the working number
`inverse` | multiplies the working number by -1
`sin num` | finds the sine of a value
`cos num` | finds the cosine of a value
`tan num` | finds the tangent of a value
`arcsin num` | finds the inverse sine of a value
`arccos num` | finds the inverse cosine of a value
`arctan num` | finds the inverse tangent of a value
`log num` | finds the log of a value
`10^ num` | finds the inverse log of a value
`ln num` | finds the natural log of a value
`e^num` | finds the inverse natural log of a value
`!num` | finds the factorial of a number. Rounds doubles to integers first
`C` | clears the display to 0
`M+`| add display to memory
`MC` | clears the memory to 0
`MRC` | prints the memory to the display
`display` |
`display type` |
